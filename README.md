# AudioVisualCircle

Welcome to AudioVisualCircle, where the harmony of sound meets the elegance of visual art. This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating intersection of audio and visual data using Python. Dive into the code and discover how to transform simple images into captivating circular visuals that dance to the rhythm of audio inputs.

## Features
- **Image Transformation**: Convert any image into a perfect circle with a transparent background, ready to be a part of your audio-visual ensemble.
- **Real-Time Audio Visualization**: Experience the live transformation of audio waves into dynamic visual patterns.
- **Tkinter GUI**: A simple yet powerful graphical user interface to display your audio-driven visuals.
- **PyAudio Integration**: Harness the power of PyAudio to capture real-time audio data for visualization.
- **Numpy Processing**: Utilize the efficiency of Numpy for fast and responsive audio data handling.

## How It Works
The script takes an image and converts it into a circular form. Then, using PyAudio, it captures audio input in real-time and translates the intensity of the sound into visual movements. The result is a beautiful, pulsating circle that changes size and color based on the audio input, all displayed within a sleek Tkinter window.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyAudio
- Tkinter
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Follow the instructions in the README to set up your environment and run the script. You're now ready to create your own audio-visual masterpieces!
